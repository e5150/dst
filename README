Installation
------------
Make sure ELFIO is available (ELFIO is a header-only C++ library written by
Serge Lamikhov-Center), you can get it from https://github.com/serge1/ELFIO
Version 3.0 of the library is included with darkstar-tools, simply unpack
elfio-3.0.tar.xz, the headers will not be installed by default, only used
to compile elfdeps.

Simply run:
    $ make
then,
    $ make install

Or,
    $ make pkg
then,
    $ installpkg /tmp/darkstar-tools-14.1-`uname -m`-1.tgz
