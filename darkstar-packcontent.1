.Op Fl e | Fl m
.Pa package-database-file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints information about the files belonging to an installed package.
It reads the the "FILE LIST:" section of a packge, and can find out if
a file or directory is still present on the system or not, and compute
the actual installed size of a package.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Verbose output, prepend lines with "<package name>:"
.It Fl e
Print only existing files.
.It Fl m
Print only missing files.
.Sh NOTES
The /install directory is always ignored, since it should never actually
stay on the file system when a package has been properly installed.

The ".new" suffix gets stripped from filenames, since install/doinst.sh
will rename such files on a clean system, might cause false results.

To accommodate glibc{,-solibs} lib/incoming/ and lib64/incoming/ are
truncated to lib/ and lib64/, respectively.
